How to use the GUI:

- The first step is to load an image. After starting the program, click on the "load image"
   button, and navigate to and double click on the image that you want to load.
- From there click the operation buttons on the right and left sides of the image to apply
   various filters and other operations to the image.
- To save the currently displayed image, click "save image", navigate to the folder you want
   the image saved to, and then type the name of the image in the field. Make sure to include
   the filetype extension you want the image saved as.
- When running the script file via command line; if done from terminal, you need the ABSOLUTE
    PATH of the file and not just the relative path.
